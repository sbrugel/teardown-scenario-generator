# Teardown Scenario Generator
A Python GUI program, made with Tkinter, which gives the user ideas for what to do in a sandbox game of Teardown. Currently just provides a text prompt on what to do, such as # of buildings to destroy, within a set number of minutes, for example. More prompts may be added later.

Soon, a feature will be added which takes a diagram of the buildings on each of the default maps, highlighting which ones should be destroyed, along with the aforementioned text prompt. This will use the PIL library for image processing.

## Running
Download `main.py` to somewhere on your PC that's easy to find, open up a terminal and run `python main.py`. Everything else should be self-explanatory
